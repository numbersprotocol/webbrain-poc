  Y Combinator created a new model for funding early-stage startups. Twice a year they invest in a batch of new companies.
  The YC partners work closely with each company to get them into the best possible shape and refine their pitch to investors.
  Each batch culminates in Demo Day, when the startups present their companies to a carefully selected, invite-only audience.
  After Demo Day, the YC alumni network helps the founders connect with investors, find customers, and recruit employees.
  Y Combinator has developed a reputation for creating and supporting companies that other investors are eager to invest in.
  YC has pioneered the way startup accelerator programs operate and has provided a blueprint for other organizations.
  The accelerator is highly competitive, with an acceptance rate of 1.5-2% for the companies that apply.
  Y Combinator provides advice and connections to its portfolio companies, helping them navigate the early stages of building a startup.
