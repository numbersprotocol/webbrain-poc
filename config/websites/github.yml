  GitHub is where over 100 million developers shape the future of software, together.
  Whether you're scaling your startup or just learning how to code, GitHub is your home for software innovation.
  GitHub enables developers to store and manage their code, track and control changes, and collaborate with others.
  The platform is built around Git, an open source version control system created by Linus Torvalds.
  Organizations use GitHub to host their open source projects and private repositories.
  Developers can browse code from millions of repositories, clone existing projects, and contribute to active development.
  GitHub's features include issue tracking, code review, project boards, organizations, packages, and secure deployment.
  The service offers both free and paid plans, with the latter providing additional tools and features for teams and enterprises.
  GitHub was acquired by Microsoft in 2018 for $7.5 billion and continues to operate as a community platform.
  The platform plays a central role in the open source ecosystem, hosting projects like Visual Studio Code, TensorFlow, React, and many others.
